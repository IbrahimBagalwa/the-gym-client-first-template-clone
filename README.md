## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a solution to the Gym Traning. The Gym challenge help us to improve our coding skills by building realistic projects.
In this exercise, you will combine BEM and tailwind. Try to use as much tailwindcss as you can. Use BEM only for custom CSS which are not available in tailwindcss. Do not use any JS frameworks like vite.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Try to implement the design below, using only HTML and you will combine BEM and tailwind,
- Do not use any JS frameworks like vite,
- When you start the project, immediately create a "development" branch where you will do all your coding,
- When you are finished, create one large pull request (dev > main), which will then be reviewed by the code reviewer of your gym,
- Figma-file like : [ The challenge - figma-file](<https://www.figma.com/file/HZ88yMmNYPNoX7wf2p3df1/Client-first-Template-11---SaaS-(Community)?node-id=242%3A2>)
- When you are done with the exercise go through the code review process that ends with a tech lead code review.
